A module is a generalization of a vector space but the scalars are from a ring.

Suppose that $R$ is a ring with multiplicative identity 1. A **left $R$-module** $M$ is an abelian group $(M,+)$ with operation $\cdot:R\times M\rightarrow M$ such that 
1. $r\cdot(x+y) = r\cdot x + r\cdot y$
2. $(r+s)\cdot x = r\cdot x + s\cdot x$
3. $(rs)\cdot x = r\cdot(s\cdot x)$
4. $1\cdot x = x$

A **right $R$-module** is defined similarly but we right-multiply by the scalar.
