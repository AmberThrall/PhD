> [!def] Symmetric Difference
> The **symmetric difference**, also known as **disjunctive union** and **set sum**, of two sets $A$ and $B$ is defined as
> $$ A\Delta B = (A\backslash B)\cup(B\backslash A). $$

The symmetric difference can also be viewed as the union minus the intersection:
$$ A\Delta B = (A\cup B)\setminus (A\cap B). $$
